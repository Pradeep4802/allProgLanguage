// Write a Javascript program which accept a number as input an insert dashes (-) between each two even numbers. For Example if you accept 025468 the output should be 0-254-6-8.

const myFish = ['angel', 'clown', 'mandarin', 'sturgeon'];
const removed = myFish.splice(2, 0, 'drum', 'guitar');
console.log(myFish);

// myFish is ["angel", "clown", "drum", "guitar", "mandarin", "sturgeon"]
// removed is [], no elements removed
